Brix is a Python library that manages communication with CityIO and CityScopeJS. This enables module makers to focus on their projects without the necessity of directly interacting with CityIO or the UI.

As depicted in the following image, module makers only need to concern themselves with the code in their modules, the utilization of Brix, and the results obtained in CityScopeJS. All internal communication mechanisms and updates are managed by the CityScope platform.
