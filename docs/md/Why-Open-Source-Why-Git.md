-> in the perspective of cities, and urban planning

# Why Open Source??
- we see a lot of cities opening up their data 
- yet when we say data driven planning, opening the tools is as important as the data, to show how we can collect, analyze, visualize (give insights) and even govern to tackle [wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem)
- These tools may have impact in certain decisions, it is ***crucial*** that is transparent, to undergo scrutiny from researchers and the public.
  - same way it is always better to use a well known crypto algorithm
- tangible outcome for the City Science Initiative

# Why Git?
- git is a distributed version control system, heavily used by the software industry (and BTW, city science group)
- Within a year, the linux kernel handles up to 4,300 developers to work in a single system *
- That averages to 8.5 changes/hour *
- Clear example of large scale collaboration 
  - Standing on a bold assumption that collaborative urban planning and "coding" is the same thing
  - Can we extract how this works to a bottom up approach of planning?
