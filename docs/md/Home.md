Welcome to the [cityscope.github.io](https://cityscope.github.io) wiki!

This organization consists two types of repositories.

We are generally open to different methodologies and suggestions from the City Science Network, we should think together how we work together!! ðŸ˜ƒ 


1. Tools

    Repositories having the prefix of ```CS_``` are the bare tools that commonly used across city projects.

2. Cities

    Cities have their own repositories that includes links (more exactly submodules) of the above tools and other things. These repos start with ```CSL_```.
