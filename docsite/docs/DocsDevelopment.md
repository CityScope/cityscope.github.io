-   complete your code edits, push or PR to `dev`
-   build the app and push the build to remote `master` using `npm run gh`
-   go to GH repo settings: https://github.com/CityScope/cityscope.github.io/settings
-   make sure `source` is set to `master`
-   make sure `custom domain` is set to `https://cityscope.media.mit.edu`
