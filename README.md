# Welcome to CityScope!

![alt text](/docs/cs_an.jpg)

### Ready to build your own CityScope platform?

Most importantly, CityScope is not one tool but a whole slew of tools [Hardware & software] aimed to provide urban modeling and simulation solutions with an emphasis on UI/UX.

- this [page](https://cityscope.github.io) serves overview of the CityScope open-source development

- the [wiki](https://github.com/CityScope/cityscope.github.io/wiki) is for high level documentation

- [Past CityScope deployments](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cityscope/overview/)

#### As a starting point, it is important to identify what kind of CityScope project you had in mind.

For example, if you wish to build a table with Lego grid scanning and project back a visualization onto the table, the following repos will serve you:

- [building the table's hardware and installation](https://github.com/CityScope/cityscope.github.io/tree/master/CS_Hardware)

- [cityIO](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_CityIO): connecting scanned Legos to visualization or 3rd party tools for analysis

- LEGO grids scanners:

  - [CityScoPy](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_CityScoPy): currently maintained, fits CityScope Modular Architecture
  - [cityscopeJS_Scanner](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_cityscopeJS_Scanner): In-browser scanner

- Legacy grid scanners, will require maintenance to fit cityIO current data formats:

  - [Rhino/Grasshopper](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_Rhino_Grasshopper_Template)
  - [Unity3d](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_CityScope_Unity)

* [CityScopeJS - CityScope web frontend](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_cityscopeJS)
* [Simple projection mapping for static images/videos](https://github.com/CityScope/CS_cityscopeJS_Projection)

This is only one form by which CityScope tools can come together to create a platform! There are many other potential combinations.
