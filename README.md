# Welcome to CityScope! 

![alt text](/docs/cs_an.jpg)

### Ready to build your own CityScope platform? 
Most importantly, CityScope is not one tool but a whole slew of tools [Hardware & software] aimed to provide urban modeling and simulation solutions with an emphasis on UI/UX.  

- the [page](https://cityscope.github.io) serves overview of the cityscope platform

- the [wiki](https://github.com/CityScope/cityscope.github.io/wiki) is for high level documentation
 
- Some examples for previous CS deployments here: https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/cityscope/overview/

--- 
#### As a starting point, it is important to identify what kind of CityScope project you had in mind. 

For example, if you wish to build a table with Lego grid scanning and project back a visualization onto the table, the following repos will serve you:
- [building the table's hardware and installation](https://github.com/CityScope/cityscope.github.io/tree/master/CS_Hardware)
- [projection mapping]( https://github.com/CityScope/CS_prjmapJS) [for web apps, the next two repos has PM internally]
- scanning and analyzing lego grids:
    - In Rhino/Grasshopper: https://github.com/CityScope/CS_Rhino_Grasshopper_Template
    - in Unity3d: https://github.com/CityScope/CS_CityScope_Unity
    - In Javascript [WIP]: https://github.com/CityScope/CS_cityscopeJS
connecting scanned Legos to visualization or 3rd party tools for analysis: https://github.com/CityScope/CS_CityIO_Backend

----
This is only one form by which CityScope tools can come together to create a platform! There are many other potential combinations, depending on [3].

### We'd appreciate to get your feedback, here or through git issues/pull requests.
